# grouping

- type: `Grouping`

An object representing a group of resources, where each group has a title and an array of resource objects. Resource objects, like events, can have any shape or properties, but each should have a unique identifier via the id field and a "label" or name as provided by the label property.

```js
Grouping {
  title: string, // title of the group
  resources: arrayOf({
    id: string | number, // must be unique
    label: string // name of the resource
  })
}
```
